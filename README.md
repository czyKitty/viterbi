genDieNumber.py
This program would generate a sequence of random dice with length n.

viterbi.py
This program perform the viterbi algorithm with a sequence that¡¯s being generated by the genDieNumber(n) function.

genExample.py
This program would generate example text with the rolls, dice, and viterbi prediction of dice.
The program will take two command line arguments:the name of the output file and the size of the example.
To run the program: python3 genExample.py <outputFileName><n>

evaluate.py
This program would calculate the average accuracy and MCC of the viterbi program with random generated result (n in range 1000~10000, with step size 100 and for each step size, calculate the average performance)
The program will take one command line argument:the name of the output file.
The output file will contain a list of n, accuracy, and MCC.
To run the program: python3 evaluate.py <outputFileName>
